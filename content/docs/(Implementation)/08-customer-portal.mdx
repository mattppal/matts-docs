In this lesson, you'll lean on Stripe's Customer Portal to remove entire classes of custom billing UI.

The Portal consolidates PM updates, plan changes, and cancellations, removing custom billing UIs and reducing support while ensuring Stripe remains the source of truth.

- Create Portal Sessions for billing management.
- Configure Portal to allow payment method updates and plan changes.
- **Primary redirect**: If user already has an active subscription, send them to Portal instead of Checkout.
- Replace custom billing UI with Portal links.
- Set `return_url` back to your app.
- Handle upgrades/downgrades through Portal; reflect changes via webhooks.

Next: translate these flows into a simple, predictable frontend.
