This lesson makes your pipeline resilient: verify, dedupe, and process asynchronously.

Async handlers and signature verification ensure security and reliability. Idempotency protects against duplicates and replays, keeping your database consistent.

- Return 200 from webhook endpoints immediately; process asynchronously.
- Verify webhook signatures.
- Use `stripe_event_id` for idempotency/deduplication.
- Guard against replays and out-of-order delivery using `processed` and created timestamps.

You now have a complete mental model and implementation path for a Stripeâ€‘first subscription system.
