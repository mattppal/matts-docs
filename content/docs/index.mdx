This course is a deep dive into subscription billing with Stripe. 

We focus on the core patterns and everything you need (and only what you need) to implement a simple subscription app.

This course is tailored to SaaS products with 1 or 2 plan types. It's ideal for the new dev or vibe coder who wants to get a handle on subscription billing.

Skip the payment processing headaches. This isn't another tutorialâ€”it's a systems-focused deep dive into subscription billing that actually works in production.

Perfect for developers who understand that good architecture beats clever hacks, and who want patterns that play nicely with AI tools.

## What You'll Grok

- **The Stripe mental model** - How checkout, webhooks, and subscriptions actually fit together
- **Webhook-driven architecture** - Why async event processing is your friend (and how to do it right)
- **State synchronization patterns** - Keep your app and Stripe in perfect harmony
- **Frontend simplicity** - Let Stripe handle the complex UI, you handle the logic

## The Flow

We're breaking this into 4 digestible chunks:

1. **Getting Started** - Mental models and core patterns
2. **Webhooks & Data** - Event-driven architecture that scales
3. **Implementation** - Real code, real patterns, real solutions
4. **Security & Control** - Access patterns and error handling done right

Each section builds on the last. By the end, you'll have a mental framework for subscription billing that you can implement with confidence (and copy-paste with your AI assistant).
