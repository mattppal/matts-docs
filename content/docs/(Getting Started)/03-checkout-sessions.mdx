description: Use hosted Checkout and pre-check existing subscriptions before creating a session.

In this lesson, you'll wire the primitives into a user‑friendly flow that avoids duplicate subscriptions and keeps billing logic out of your app.

Using hosted Checkout avoids PCI scope, standardizes subscription creation, and the pre-check prevents sending active subscribers back to Checkout—redirect them to the Customer Portal instead.

One subscription per customer.

- **Always** redirect to Stripe Checkout. Never build custom payment forms.
- Set `customer_creation: 'always'`.
- Use `mode: 'subscription'` for subscriptions.
- **Pre-check** before creating checkout:
  - If user has an active subscription -> redirect to Customer Portal.
  - If no active subscription -> create a new Checkout Session.
